       "      <td>© 2018The microstructure and corrosion behavior of the hot-rolled Ti-30Zr-5Al-3V-xFe alloys were investigated. All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys.</td>\n",

To enhance the innovation creation in universities, the relevant factors that affect such creation should be investigated. Hence, this study aims to investigate the critical factors that affect research and innovation creation in public universities in Thailand. The relevant literature was reviewed and research was conducted using a qualitative research approach. Data were collected from in-depth interviews of 11 executives purposely selected from 8 frontier public universities in Thailand. The data were analysed using NVivo qualitative research software. Results revealed 15 critical factors in the following descending order: resource, goal, database and information technology, working environment, managerial process, policy, network, organisational structure, human resource management, government support, strategy, compensation, organisation culture, vision and leader factor. Moreover, results identified the issues that should be addressed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>© 2018Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P &lt; 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs &gt; 0.9, P &lt; 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings.</td>\n",

       "      <td>© 2018 Society for Innovative Research. All rights reserved.Thai farmers usually have low formal education and lack of knowledge on soil quality improvement and proper use of fertilizers. After a few years of farming, they try to trespass in conserved forest areas because of soil deterioration in their own limited expanses of farmland and they believe that soils in the conserved area are more fertile than soils in their own farms. Consequently, most of them are arrested, creating individual and family problems. This project will compare the physical and chemical properties of soils from farmlands and soils from the conserved area. The results showed that soil nutrients from both farmlands and soils from the conserved area were not significantly different in nearly all parameters of analysis except soils from the conserved area have more organic matters and nitrogen content. However, both soils from farmlands and conserved area were sandy loam which has low water content and low cation exchange capacity. The analysis data were informed to the farmers and suggested them to improve their farmlands using appropriate organic matters and suitable plants have to be chosen to match the sandy loam soil in order to get more productivity. Water supply management also has to be improved. However, mixed farming is another good planting method. Some kinds of plants can fix nitrogen in soil such as legumes. They can enrich soil nutrients. The most important issue is that farmers have to be acknowledged that soils in the conserved areas are not more fertile than soils in their farmlands. Therefore, in the future, farmers will not trespass conserve areas.</td>\n",

       "      <td>© 2018Background and Aims: Wire-guided biliary cannulation has been demonstrated to improve cannulation rates and reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), but the impact of wire caliber has not been studied. This study compares successful cannulation rates and ERCP adverse events by using a 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewire. Methods: A randomized, single blinded, prospective, multicenter trial at 9 high-volume tertiary-care referral centers in the Asia-Pacific region was performed. Patients with an intact papilla and conventional anatomy who did not have malignancy in the head of the pancreas or ampulla and were undergoing ERCP were recruited. ERCP was performed by using a standardized cannulation algorithm, and patients were randomized to either a 0.025-inch or 0.035-inch guidewire. The primary outcomes of the study were successful wire-guided cannulation and the incidence of PEP. Overall successful cannulation and ERCP adverse events also were studied. Results: A total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary wire-guided biliary cannulation rate was similar in 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch wire groups (80.7% vs 80.3%; P =.90). The rate of PEP between the 0.025-inch and the 0.035-inch wire groups did not differ significantly (7.8% vs 9.3%; P =.51). No differences were noted in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Similar rates of successful cannulation and PEP were demonstrated in the use of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01408264.)</td>\n",

All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys.   \n",

       "2  © 2018Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings.   \n",

This study compares successful cannulation rates and ERCP adverse events by using a 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewire. Methods: A randomized, single blinded, prospective, multicenter trial at 9 high-volume tertiary-care referral centers in the Asia-Pacific region was performed. Patients with an intact papilla and conventional anatomy who did not have malignancy in the head of the pancreas or ampulla and were undergoing ERCP were recruited. ERCP was performed by using a standardized cannulation algorithm, and patients were randomized to either a 0.025-inch or 0.035-inch guidewire. The primary outcomes of the study were successful wire-guided cannulation and the incidence of PEP. Overall successful cannulation and ERCP adverse events also were studied. Results: A total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary wire-guided biliary cannulation rate was similar in 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch wire groups (80.7% vs 80.3%; P =.90). The rate of PEP between the 0.025-inch and the 0.035-inch wire groups did not differ significantly (7.8% vs 9.3%; P =.51). No differences were noted in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Similar rates of successful cannulation and PEP were demonstrated in the use of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01408264.)   \n",

       "      <td>© 2018Background and Aims: Wire-guided biliary cannulation has been demonstrated to improve cannulation rates and reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), but the impact of wire caliber has not been studied. This study compares successful cannulation rates and ERCP adverse events by using a 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewire. Methods: A randomized, single blinded, prospective, multicenter trial at 9 high-volume tertiary-care referral centers in the Asia-Pacific region was performed. Patients with an intact papilla and conventional anatomy who did not have malignancy in the head of the pancreas or ampulla and were undergoing ERCP were recruited. ERCP was performed by using a standardized cannulation algorithm, and patients were randomized to either a 0.025-inch or 0.035-inch guidewire. The primary outcomes of the study were successful wire-guided cannulation and the incidence of PEP. Overall successful cannulation and ERCP adverse events also were studied. Results: A total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary wire-guided biliary cannulation rate was similar in 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch wire groups (80.7% vs 80.3%; P =.90). The rate of PEP between the 0.025-inch and the 0.035-inch wire groups did not differ significantly (7.8% vs 9.3%; P =.51). No differences were noted in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Similar rates of successful cannulation and PEP were demonstrated in the use of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01408264.)</td>\n",

All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys.   \n",

To enhance the innovation creation in universities, the relevant factors that affect such creation should be investigated. Hence, this study aims to investigate the critical factors that affect research and innovation creation in public universities in Thailand. The relevant literature was reviewed and research was conducted using a qualitative research approach. Data were collected from in-depth interviews of 11 executives purposely selected from 8 frontier public universities in Thailand. The data were analysed using NVivo qualitative research software. Results revealed 15 critical factors in the following descending order: resource, goal, database and information technology, working environment, managerial process, policy, network, organisational structure, human resource management, government support, strategy, compensation, organisation culture, vision and leader factor. Moreover, results identified the issues that should be addressed.   \n",
       "2  © 2018Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings.   \n",
       "3                                     © 2018 Society for Innovative Research. All rights reserved.Thai farmers usually have low formal education and lack of knowledge on soil quality improvement and proper use of fertilizers. After a few years of farming, they try to trespass in conserved forest areas because of soil deterioration in their own limited expanses of farmland and they believe that soils in the conserved area are more fertile than soils in their own farms. Consequently, most of them are arrested, creating individual and family problems. This project will compare the physical and chemical properties of soils from farmlands and soils from the conserved area. The results showed that soil nutrients from both farmlands and soils from the conserved area were not significantly different in nearly all parameters of analysis except soils from the conserved area have more organic matters and nitrogen content. However, both soils from farmlands and conserved area were sandy loam which has low water content and low cation exchange capacity. The analysis data were informed to the farmers and suggested them to improve their farmlands using appropriate organic matters and suitable plants have to be chosen to match the sandy loam soil in order to get more productivity. Water supply management also has to be improved. However, mixed farming is another good planting method. Some kinds of plants can fix nitrogen in soil such as legumes. They can enrich soil nutrients. The most important issue is that farmers have to be acknowledged that soils in the conserved areas are not more fertile than soils in their farmlands. Therefore, in the future, farmers will not trespass conserve areas.   \n",

       "      <td>© 2018The microstructure and corrosion behavior of the hot-rolled Ti-30Zr-5Al-3V-xFe alloys were investigated. All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys.</td>\n",

To enhance the innovation creation in universities, the relevant factors that affect such creation should be investigated. Hence, this study aims to investigate the critical factors that affect research and innovation creation in public universities in Thailand. The relevant literature was reviewed and research was conducted using a qualitative research approach. Data were collected from in-depth interviews of 11 executives purposely selected from 8 frontier public universities in Thailand. The data were analysed using NVivo qualitative research software. Results revealed 15 critical factors in the following descending order: resource, goal, database and information technology, working environment, managerial process, policy, network, organisational structure, human resource management, government support, strategy, compensation, organisation culture, vision and leader factor. Moreover, results identified the issues that should be addressed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>© 2018Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P &lt; 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs &gt; 0.9, P &lt; 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings.</td>\n",

       "      <td>© 2018 Society for Innovative Research. All rights reserved.Thai farmers usually have low formal education and lack of knowledge on soil quality improvement and proper use of fertilizers. After a few years of farming, they try to trespass in conserved forest areas because of soil deterioration in their own limited expanses of farmland and they believe that soils in the conserved area are more fertile than soils in their own farms. Consequently, most of them are arrested, creating individual and family problems. This project will compare the physical and chemical properties of soils from farmlands and soils from the conserved area. The results showed that soil nutrients from both farmlands and soils from the conserved area were not significantly different in nearly all parameters of analysis except soils from the conserved area have more organic matters and nitrogen content. However, both soils from farmlands and conserved area were sandy loam which has low water content and low cation exchange capacity. The analysis data were informed to the farmers and suggested them to improve their farmlands using appropriate organic matters and suitable plants have to be chosen to match the sandy loam soil in order to get more productivity. Water supply management also has to be improved. However, mixed farming is another good planting method. Some kinds of plants can fix nitrogen in soil such as legumes. They can enrich soil nutrients. The most important issue is that farmers have to be acknowledged that soils in the conserved areas are not more fertile than soils in their farmlands. Therefore, in the future, farmers will not trespass conserve areas.</td>\n",

       "      <td>© 2018Background and Aims: Wire-guided biliary cannulation has been demonstrated to improve cannulation rates and reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), but the impact of wire caliber has not been studied. This study compares successful cannulation rates and ERCP adverse events by using a 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewire. Methods: A randomized, single blinded, prospective, multicenter trial at 9 high-volume tertiary-care referral centers in the Asia-Pacific region was performed. Patients with an intact papilla and conventional anatomy who did not have malignancy in the head of the pancreas or ampulla and were undergoing ERCP were recruited. ERCP was performed by using a standardized cannulation algorithm, and patients were randomized to either a 0.025-inch or 0.035-inch guidewire. The primary outcomes of the study were successful wire-guided cannulation and the incidence of PEP. Overall successful cannulation and ERCP adverse events also were studied. Results: A total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary wire-guided biliary cannulation rate was similar in 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch wire groups (80.7% vs 80.3%; P =.90). The rate of PEP between the 0.025-inch and the 0.035-inch wire groups did not differ significantly (7.8% vs 9.3%; P =.51). No differences were noted in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Similar rates of successful cannulation and PEP were demonstrated in the use of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01408264.)</td>\n",

All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys.   \n",

To enhance the innovation creation in universities, the relevant factors that affect such creation should be investigated. Hence, this study aims to investigate the critical factors that affect research and innovation creation in public universities in Thailand. The relevant literature was reviewed and research was conducted using a qualitative research approach. Data were collected from in-depth interviews of 11 executives purposely selected from 8 frontier public universities in Thailand. The data were analysed using NVivo qualitative research software. Results revealed 15 critical factors in the following descending order: resource, goal, database and information technology, working environment, managerial process, policy, network, organisational structure, human resource management, government support, strategy, compensation, organisation culture, vision and leader factor. Moreover, results identified the issues that should be addressed.   \n",
       "2  © 2018Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings.   \n",
       "3                                     © 2018 Society for Innovative Research. All rights reserved.Thai farmers usually have low formal education and lack of knowledge on soil quality improvement and proper use of fertilizers. After a few years of farming, they try to trespass in conserved forest areas because of soil deterioration in their own limited expanses of farmland and they believe that soils in the conserved area are more fertile than soils in their own farms. Consequently, most of them are arrested, creating individual and family problems. This project will compare the physical and chemical properties of soils from farmlands and soils from the conserved area. The results showed that soil nutrients from both farmlands and soils from the conserved area were not significantly different in nearly all parameters of analysis except soils from the conserved area have more organic matters and nitrogen content. However, both soils from farmlands and conserved area were sandy loam which has low water content and low cation exchange capacity. The analysis data were informed to the farmers and suggested them to improve their farmlands using appropriate organic matters and suitable plants have to be chosen to match the sandy loam soil in order to get more productivity. Water supply management also has to be improved. However, mixed farming is another good planting method. Some kinds of plants can fix nitrogen in soil such as legumes. They can enrich soil nutrients. The most important issue is that farmers have to be acknowledged that soils in the conserved areas are not more fertile than soils in their farmlands. Therefore, in the future, farmers will not trespass conserve areas.   \n",

This study compares successful cannulation rates and ERCP adverse events by using a 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewire. Methods: A randomized, single blinded, prospective, multicenter trial at 9 high-volume tertiary-care referral centers in the Asia-Pacific region was performed. Patients with an intact papilla and conventional anatomy who did not have malignancy in the head of the pancreas or ampulla and were undergoing ERCP were recruited. ERCP was performed by using a standardized cannulation algorithm, and patients were randomized to either a 0.025-inch or 0.035-inch guidewire. The primary outcomes of the study were successful wire-guided cannulation and the incidence of PEP. Overall successful cannulation and ERCP adverse events also were studied. Results: A total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary wire-guided biliary cannulation rate was similar in 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch wire groups (80.7% vs 80.3%; P =.90). The rate of PEP between the 0.025-inch and the 0.035-inch wire groups did not differ significantly (7.8% vs 9.3%; P =.51). No differences were noted in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Similar rates of successful cannulation and PEP were demonstrated in the use of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01408264.)   \n",
